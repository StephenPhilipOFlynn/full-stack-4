This is a restaurant called Leticia's that is based in Dublin city and specialises in Brazilian and Spanish food.

Features

Navigation bar: 
A navigation bar allows for moving between 5 different sections of the webpage with relative ease. 

Owl Carousel:
An owl picture carousel loops between six pictures, immediately giving the home page colour and light. 


Unfortunately I ran out of time to build the backend restaurant booking system using Django, I intend to do this on my next attempt at this project. I also ran out of time to review responsive design on the site, and fine tune many aspects of the restaurant detail. I will continue to work on these aspects at my next attempt.
