Unfortunately I ran out of time to build the backend restaurant booking system using Django, I intend to do this on my next attempt at this project. I also ran out of time to check responsive design on the site, and fine tune many aspects of teh restaurant detail. I will continue to work on these aspects at my next attempt.
